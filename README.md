# 🏛️ The Hex
Welcome to the The Hex — a private web app where members can write anonymous stories visible to the world, but only club members can see the authors behind them. This project practices key skills like user authentication, role-based permissions, secure password handling, and database modeling.

A placeholder project for The Odin Project, built with Lovable as a test.
